# home_search
Web Scraping tool to check continuously if a chamber is availble and notify the user if that's the case.
# Usage
This project helps you monitor API availability. The Django server provides a web interface for viewing the status, and the Python script continuously calls the API. If something becomes available, you'll receive a notification.

To use the Django server, access it in your web browser. The Python script runs in the background and doesn't require user interaction.
